I want to give Bernie a fair shout, so I went to his website to see what are his proposals for reforming Wall Street. There are none (his "Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act" is a campaign slogan with the word 'bill' slapped on the cover. It's not serious). I wanted to see Bernie run long before he ever declared his candidacy, but the flimsiness of his policies concerns me. I am increasingly coming to the conclusion he is the Ted Cruz of the Democratic Party - good at channelling anger and pressing the base's buttons, but at the expense of offering unrealistically simple solutions to complex problems.
