description: "A U.N. panel has declared that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who has remained confined within the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, is being \"arbitrarily detained.\" The decision from the U.N.'s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is not legally binding, though it carries significant weight."

I have read the working group's reasoning (because I am a bit odd like that). If you accept their underlying premise, which is that Assange's asylum claim was legitimate and based on a well-founded fear of _persecution,
inhumane treatment, and physical harm, _then what flows from that holds a certain amount of sense.

Nonetheless, the rest of us were left going "wait, what?"
