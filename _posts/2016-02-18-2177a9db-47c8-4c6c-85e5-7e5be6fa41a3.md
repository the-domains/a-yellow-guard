Mike Smithson is a keen observer of the British political scene, but on this one I think he has got it wrong.

> With Rubio faltering John Kasich could be the favoured non-Trump GOP contender in today's New Hampshire primary [https://t.co/iWbEq7EQNi][0]--- Mike Smithson (@MSmithsonPB) [February 9, 2016][1]

Obviously, I don't think he is wrong about Kasich being a strong contender for second: if you \[follow\](http://www.twitter.com/cripipper) me on Twitter you will know I have been saying for a while now that Kasich was going to be in the final shake-up in New Hampshire. But I think it is highly unlikely that Bernie Sanders supporters will switch to vote for Kasich in the Republican primary in order to stop Trump.
In fact, it's more likely that independent voters in New Hampshire who are thinking of voting for Bernie would switch to the GOP primary to vote \*\*for\*\* Trump than against. They are fishing for a lot of the same voters in The Granite State.
Such are the strange times we live in.
