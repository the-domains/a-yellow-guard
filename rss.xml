            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>All the terrible things Hillary Clinton has done - in one big list</h1><p>By DOVER, N.H. (MarketWatch) - I have a confession to make: I can't keep up. Am I supposed to hate Hillary Rodham Clinton because she's too left-wing, or too right-wing? Because she's too feminist, or not feminist enough? Because she's too clever a politician, or too clumsy?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e0723bea537f8c41b1af6b94a86e72f1febd065e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Bernie Sanders the Ted Cruz of the Democrats?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is Bernie Sanders the Ted Cruz of the Democrats?</h1><p>I want to give Bernie a fair shout, so I went to his website to see what are his proposals for reforming Wall Street. There are none (his "Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act" is a campaign slogan with the word 'bill' slapped on the cover. It's not serious). I wanted to see Bernie run long before he ever declared his candidacy, but the flimsiness of his policies concerns me. I am increasingly coming to the conclusion he is the Ted Cruz of the Democratic Party - good at channelling anger and pressing the base's buttons, but at the expense of offering unrealistically simple solutions to complex problems.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/54ec8fe24e0fc9c4a6d02caf74790f015281a062.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Three members of U.N. panel said Assange was 'arbitrarily detained.' One didn't. Here's his dissent.</h1><p>A U.N. panel has declared that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who has remained confined within the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, is being "arbitrarily detained." The decision from the U.N.'s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is not legally binding, though it carries significant weight.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8ee15b1a6732f395c69cc4474e3a4ef400912fce.jpg"></article>]]></description>
