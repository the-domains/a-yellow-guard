            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>All the terrible things Hillary Clinton has done - in one big list</h1><p>By DOVER, N.H. (MarketWatch) - I have a confession to make: I can't keep up. Am I supposed to hate Hillary Rodham Clinton because she's too left-wing, or too right-wing? Because she's too feminist, or not feminist enough? Because she's too clever a politician, or too clumsy?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/567b49dd282ff9a9f11ed7a6de6c615d0ef2ff01.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Three members of U.N. panel said Assange was 'arbitrarily detained.' One didn't. Here's his dissent.</h1><p>A U.N. panel has declared that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who has remained confined within the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, is being "arbitrarily detained."
