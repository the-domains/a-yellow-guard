            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Justice Scalia was staying for free at a Texas resort</h1><p>Justice Antonin Scalia's sudden death over the weekend at a West Texas ranch raised questions about the nature of his travel, who paid for the trip and whether justices are subject to the same disclosure guidelines as other judges or federal officials.

Hillary Clinton has all the upsides and all the downsides of a political insider.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Three members of U.N. panel said Assange was 'arbitrarily detained.' One didn't. Here's his dissent.</h1><p>I have read the working group's reasoning (because I am a bit odd like that). If you accept their underlying premise, which is that Assange's asylum claim was legitimate and based on a well-founded fear of persecution,
inhumane treatment, and physical harm, then what flows from that holds a certain amount of sense.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2026b189a5ac03260a3f265c598a20d5beaccbf7.jpg"></article>]]></description>
