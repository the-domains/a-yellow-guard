            <title><![CDATA[Is Bernie Sanders the Ted Cruz of the Democrats?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is Bernie Sanders the Ted Cruz of the Democrats?</h1><p>I want to give Bernie a fair shout, so I went to his website to see what are his proposals for reforming Wall Street. There are none (his "Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act" is a campaign slogan with the word 'bill' slapped on the cover. It's not serious). I wanted to see Bernie run long before he ever declared his candidacy, but the flimsiness of his policies concerns me. I am increasingly coming to the conclusion he is the Ted Cruz of the Democratic Party - good at channelling anger and pressing the base's buttons, but at the expense of offering unrealistically simple solutions to complex problems.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/54ec8fe24e0fc9c4a6d02caf74790f015281a062.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ted Cruz's Ineligibility To Be President</h1><p>At dinner last week with two friends, one of whom is a law professor, I blithely asserted that Ted Cruz was eligible to be President, and that no serious person believes that "natural-born citizen" excludes those who were entitled to U.S. citizenship at birth, even though born outside the United States, by virtue of having a U.S. citizen as a parent.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4187329e05a4aa0764c53f527fa687fbde37634f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
