            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sorry Bernie, I take that back. Ted Cruz is a nasty piece of work.</h1><p>When Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) last month mocked Donald Trump's "New York values," it wasn't entirely clear what he was implying. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation's capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Finally, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton had a real argument over how politics works</h1><p>Bernie Sanders has all the upsides and all the downsides of a political outsider. Hillary Clinton has all the upsides and all the downsides of a political insider. That was the main takeaway from MSNBC's Democratic debate on Thursday, which was the best debate, on either side of the aisle, aired during this presidential cycle.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/69d4c4938302c0d339bc660220d65c2de63c9cab.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Three members of U.N. panel said Assange was 'arbitrarily detained.' One didn't. Here's his dissent.</h1><p>I have read the working group's reasoning (because I am a bit odd like that). If you accept their underlying premise, which is that Assange's asylum claim was legitimate and based on a well-founded fear of persecution,
inhumane treatment, and physical harm, then what flows from that holds a certain amount of sense.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2026b189a5ac03260a3f265c598a20d5beaccbf7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Bernie Sanders the Ted Cruz of the Democrats?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is Bernie Sanders the Ted Cruz of the Democrats?</h1><p>I want to give Bernie a fair shout, so I went to his website to see what are his proposals for reforming Wall Street. There are none (his "Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act" is a campaign slogan with the word 'bill' slapped on the cover. It's not serious). I wanted to see Bernie run long before he ever declared his candidacy, but the flimsiness of his policies concerns me. I am increasingly coming to the conclusion he is the Ted Cruz of the Democratic Party - good at channelling anger and pressing the base's buttons, but at the expense of offering unrealistically simple solutions to complex problems.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/54ec8fe24e0fc9c4a6d02caf74790f015281a062.jpg"></article>]]></description>
